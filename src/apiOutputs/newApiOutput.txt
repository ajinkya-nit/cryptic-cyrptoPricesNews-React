      "description": "According to Odaily, new tax measures on certain cross-border remittances in the United States took effect on January 1, 2026. Under regulations from the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service, remittance service providers are required to withhold a 1% tax on eligible transactions and report it accordingly. The regulations specify that remittances funded by cash or similar 'physical payment instruments,' such as money orders and cashier's checks, are subject to this tax. However, transactions funded through U.S. bank account transfers or using debit or credit cards are generally exempt.This measure is part of the 'Big and Beautiful' tax and spending bill promoted by U.S. President Donald Trump's administration. According to the IRS, the tax applies to overseas remitters, including U.S. citizens and residents.Tax experts have noted that cryptocurrency and stablecoin transfers are not considered taxable remittance transfers. This implies that stablecoins do not fall under the category of 'physical payment instruments' subject to the tax, although the practical implications remain uncertain.",
